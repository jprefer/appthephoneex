        When you are in the detail screen you can "Accept the Offer," "Reject the Offer,"
        or "Do Nothing." Â You can wait to see if you receive more offers to your liking,

        When you accept the offer, your credit card on file (or other payment that you chose)

            You will get an alert once the Seller ships the item. This Step brings you to the
            In-Process screen where you will be able to see items that were purchased that haven't
            been received yet. You can check to see if the item had shipped and also see the
            tracking number.

            Once you receive the package, you need to click on the order to get to the detail.&nbsp;
            Here you will be able to accept the shipment and rate the seller. And in the small
            possibility that the items are not up to your standards you may hit the Return button.&nbsp;

            .&nbsp; If you do nothing here, we will automatically accept the shipment for you
            after 48 hours of receiving. - That's It! Happy Buying
