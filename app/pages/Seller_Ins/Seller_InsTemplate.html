        Once you click on the detail, you need to put the Grade of the devices and the total
        price for all of the units including shipping. Remember once you hit the Place Offer
        button you are committing that inventory in case the buyer accepts your offer. If
        the buyer accepts your offer, you will get an alert and now its time to go to Step
        2

        The Buyer has accepted your Offer. This Step takes you to the Accepted Offers Screen
        where you will click on the order to ship it. Once you click, you will find all of
        the pertinent information for shipping the order. Once you have packed and shipped,
        you will need to enter the Shipped By and the Tracking Number.

        The Buyer will get an alert saying you shipped. Once they receive the package and
        accept it you will be alerted. Now it's time for Step 3
    </div>
    <img width="" height="" src="files/images/Presentation4a.png" class="img-default img-responsive"
    alt="Image error">
    <div>
        At this Step you will be put in the In-Process Screen where you can see all of your
        shipments before they are accepted by the buyer. You can click on any one of them
        to see the details. Once they are accepted you will get an alert that they received
        it and accepted. Once they have accepted, we will begin the process of moving the
        proceeds to your account. That's It! Happy Selling
